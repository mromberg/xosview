  The FreeBSD port now has much better support, thanks to Tom
Pavel.  From within the ports system, xosview ought to build out
of the box --- if not, it's a bug.

  For building xosview by hand, see README.netbsd, as there are
no FreeBSD-specific things at this time.

  Feel free to contact me with any *BSD concerns, or Mike and/or me
for any general xosview problems or suggestions.
