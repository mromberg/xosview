      gcc-2.4.x or earlier.  This could be considered a
      feature, but in our current particular instance,
      it hides information if one is using gcc-2.4.5
      (NetBSD-1.1 and earlier's standard gcc).  Basically, by
      nullifying __attribute__, gcc says "cvsid defined but not
      used", whereas if the __attribute__ were left alone,
      gcc-2.4.5 would say "Ignoring unknown attribute "unused"",
      followed by "cvsid defined but not used", which to me is much
      clearer about what is going on.  bgrayson 9/96  */
