  A little bit about the makefiles.  I like to make memstat from the root 
of the linux src tree.  To do this, I added memstat to the all rule, and then
created a memstat rule immediately before the modules rule.  the memstat rule
is as follows:
memstat: dummy
	$(MAKE) -C memstat CFLAGS="$(CFLAGS) $(MODFLAGS)"

  You may need to edit memstat.h.  

  To get the hacker-insmod utility, go to a site with dosemu and get the tar
file.  It is in its own tar file, and is fairly small.  Without it, the module 
will have to live in /proc/net or you will have to patch ksyms.c.

  Let me know how it works for you!
