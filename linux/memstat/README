  This directory containes the source for a linux kernel module.  The
module here will cause a new entry (/proc/memstat) to show up in the 
proc filesystem.  The code for the memstat module is very similar to the
code which produces the /proc/meminfo output.  There is one difference.
/proc/memstat has output which allows xosview to display the percentage
of memory which is shared.  See README.linux for further details.
