  The majority of the xosview source code is covered by the GNU
General Public License (GPL), which is presented in the file
COPYING.GPL.

  In addition, a portion of the NetBSD port's code is covered under
the traditional BSD copyright, which is presented in COPYING.BSD.  If you
plan on modifying or distributing any portion of this code, make sure
that you agree to the terms in the BSD copyright (which in general is
less restrictive than the GPL, from what I've seen, but I'm not a
lawyer-type).  These files are:
  netbsd/swapinternal.cc

  Lastly, various portions of the xosview source code were developed
by various authors who have intentionally chosen to allow the user
to choose between the BSD copyright or the GPL copyright.  These files
are:
  fieldmeterdecay.h
  fieldmeterdecay.cc
  general.h
