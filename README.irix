  The IRIX port has support for load, cpu and mem meter. You're welcome
to send me patches.

  The cpu meter has a new X resource cpuFormat, with the possible values
of single, all, auto or both. It determines how cpu meters are handled
for multiprocessors: single displays only meters for each cpu, all
displays only a cumulative meter for all cpus, both displays both and
auto behaves like both on mp machines and single on up machines.

  I experienced some errors with the cpu meter on O2.


  It is tested on: 

  IP20, IP22, IP27, IP30, IP32 and IP35.
