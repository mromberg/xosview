  The IRIX port supports:

    - load meter

    - cpu meter: The cpu meter has a new X resource cpuFormat, with the
                 possible values of single, all, auto or both. It
                 determines how cpu meters are handled for
                 multiprocessors: single displays only meters for each
                 cpu, all displays only a cumulative meter for all cpus,
                 both displays both and auto behaves like both on mp
                 machines and single on up machines.

    - mem meter

    - gfx meter: Displays swapbuffers/second.

  Of course, you're welcome to send me patches.

  For the gfx meter, sadc is forked to read the activity. The sadc
  process is handled from the singleton SarMeter, which reads the binary
  data from sadc and converts it into structures. Currently, it parses
  gfxinfo and diskinfo data. The diskinfo can be used to create a disk
  meter, but I do not have the time currently. As said above, send me
  patches ;).


  It is tested on: 

  IP20, IP22, IP27, IP30, IP32 and IP35.
