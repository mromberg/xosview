- Make a README.devel for developers

- Move stuff out of aclocal.m4 and into more specific m4 files.

- Do something (if anything can be done) about X11 inc/library paths

- Transparent almost works.  Windom moves do not update the background

- Linux netmeter's peak does not seem to relate to resource setting

- Add a linux interrupt rate meter (int/sec)

- Update the install scripts for X11R7 locations (or just where distros
  now dump stuff.

- Create an rpm spec file (as an example) to hold build package deps if
  nothing else.

- Fix any other ports for the new C++ update.  Should
  be simple.  Mostly char * -> std::string conversion.

- Look into some kind of decay option for the used labels

- Look into a decay only option on the field meter.

- Add Xft support for new fangled (and installed by default) fuzzy fonts
  (http://www.keithp.com/~keithp/render/Xft.tutorial)

- Look into seperating the X11 drawing interface into a more abstracted layer.
  Make it easier to support other drawing systems Wayland etc.
  First 1/2 of this is done.  All drawing routines now in a seperate
  class.  Need to convert the meter draw() methods to pass a Graphics object
  and the meters to render into it.  Right now they do.  But through
  XWin pass throughs.

- Add a "scripting" interface so new meters (for non rapidly updating)
  things could be written in python/ruby/shell?

- Add a clickable button(s) to add, remove, reconfigure (int/cpu format) on the
  fly?

- FIXME ? : "xosview*borderwidth" seems to be unused !?

  Linux: Add support for some of the stats generated by the lm78 kernel
    module.  Fist, I need to get it (lm78) working well on one of my
    systems.

  NetBSD:  Add interrupt-rate meter, add tape-drive meter (or
    arbitrary device throughput meter?)

* Do if(dolegends_) fix for loadmeter.cc for all ports.
   - Fixed on linux.  Loadmeter peaks at critical level (no re-scaling)

* Make xosview re-check resources when the resources are changed,
    or when a signal is sent to it, or a key is pressed in it?

* Add command-line on/off switches for most, if not all, meters.
  Fix MeterMaker in the other (non-NetBSD) ports to check for all meters,
    not just load and serial.

* Add command-line arg for specifying an instance name, so that we can
    say "xosview -name xosview-stipple" and have the xosview-stipple*
    resources read in also.
  Redo the fieldmeter drawing code -- it (and the decayfieldmeter
    code) is very ugly.

* Add in stipple support for those stuck with 1-bit displays (black,
    or white) (just MacBSD people?).

* Make a better resource for turning meters off/on.  Currently, we
    overload other resources.

  NetBSD:  Clean up symbol defs in netbsd.cc
  NetBSD:  Merge swapinternal.cc (or at least a lot of it) into kernel.cc
  NetBSD, Linux, hp:  Instead of allowing each meter to figure out the
    per-sec rate for a measurement (page, disk, net), add a fieldmeter
    function that does the calculation, using SAMPLE_MSECS and
    priority_.  See the netbsd/diskmeter.cc code for what I think is the
    correct formula (it took me a few attempts to get it right!)

*   Fix depend stuff Get autolookup of X stuff -- perhaps use xmkmf/imake
    in configure?  X11R7 now seems to use /usr and things like /usr/share.
    So, update the install to do that.  We just have a binary, man page and
    resource file.

  Change the CacheColor stuff from Tom Pavel's patches to be a
    new memWiredColor.

* Change the names on all NetBSD* functions to just be BSD*,
    since they are shared across multiple *BSD ports.

* Merge in NetBSD interrupt support.

* Add auto-detect for number of interrupts for NetBSD.

x Add in support and auto-detect for new NetBSD UVM stuff.
  (added, but no auto-detect).

* The Netmeter under *BSD has wrap problems:  the internal
    counter in the kernel is 32 bits, so once we receive 4G of
    traffic, we wrap, and it looks like we received a lot of
    negative traffic?  (I _think_ this is the cause).
