- XAPPRESDIR

- Add a resouce to specify the meter ordering

- Add cpu powersave policy display

- Opton for labels/used on same line as caption

- Make all data gathering classes interact through a clear interface.

- Make the linux netmeter support individual interfaces.  Possibly even
  the loopback

- Look into a decay only option on the field meter.

- if using Xft fonts rescale the font based on the height of the meter.

- Add a "scripting" interface so new meters (for non rapidly updating)
  things could be written in python/ruby/shell?

- Add a clickable button(s) to add, remove, reconfigure (int/cpu format) on the
  fly?

- Linux: Add support for some of the stats generated by the lm78 kernel
    module.  Fist, I need to get it (lm78) working well on one of my
    systems.

-  NetBSD:  Add tape-drive meter (or arbitrary device throughput meter?)

* Make xosview re-check resources when the resources are changed,
    or when a signal is sent to it, or a key is pressed in it?

* Redo the fieldmeter drawing code -- it (and the decayfieldmeter
    code) is very ugly.
