=========== For 1.20.0

- Update SF website

===================== Post 1.20.0

- Make some base classes for the shared linux/bsd meters

- 32 bit truecolor transparency

- Make all data gathering classes interact through a clear interface.

- Add -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG to enable-debug (available with GCC 3.4.0 and later)

- Make the linux netmeter support individual interfaces.  Possibly even
  the loopback

- Have some meter base class(s) remember previous values and call things
  like drawfields() drawlegend() etc only if the values have not changed.
  This way the leaf classes just gather stats and report back.  But don't
  worry about display.

- Transparent almost works.  Windom moves do not update the background

- Pass a Graphics to checkResources

- Fix any other ports for the new C++ update.  Should
  be simple"ish".  Mostly char * -> std::string conversion.

- Look into a decay only option on the field meter.

- if using Xft fonts rescale the font based on the height of the meter.

- See if the new X11Graphics can be done as a pass down from the top
  sorta thing.  Right now some low level meters have to grab a Graphics
  from the parent to draw from checkevent.  Should we even be drawing
  in checkevent?

- Add a "scripting" interface so new meters (for non rapidly updating)
  things could be written in python/ruby/shell?

- Add a clickable button(s) to add, remove, reconfigure (int/cpu format) on the
  fly?

- Linux: Add support for some of the stats generated by the lm78 kernel
    module.  Fist, I need to get it (lm78) working well on one of my
    systems.

-  NetBSD:  Add interrupt-rate meter, add tape-drive meter (or
    arbitrary device throughput meter?)

* Do if(dolegends_) fix for loadmeter.cc for all ports.
   - Fixed on linux.  Loadmeter peaks at critical level (no re-scaling)

* Make xosview re-check resources when the resources are changed,
    or when a signal is sent to it, or a key is pressed in it?

* Redo the fieldmeter drawing code -- it (and the decayfieldmeter
    code) is very ugly.

* Add in stipple support for those stuck with 1-bit displays (black,
    or white) (just MacBSD people?).

* Make a better resource for turning meters off/on.  Currently, we
    overload other resources.

  NetBSD:  Clean up symbol defs in netbsd.cc
  NetBSD:  Merge swapinternal.cc (or at least a lot of it) into kernel.cc
  NetBSD, Linux, hp:  Instead of allowing each meter to figure out the
    per-sec rate for a measurement (page, disk, net), add a fieldmeter
    function that does the calculation, using SAMPLE_MSECS and
    priority_.  See the netbsd/diskmeter.cc code for what I think is the
    correct formula (it took me a few attempts to get it right!)

  Change the CacheColor stuff from Tom Pavel's patches to be a
    new memWiredColor.

* Change the names on all NetBSD* functions to just be BSD*,
    since they are shared across multiple *BSD ports.

* Merge in NetBSD interrupt support.

* Add auto-detect for number of interrupts for NetBSD.

x Add in support and auto-detect for new NetBSD UVM stuff.
  (added, but no auto-detect).

* The Netmeter under *BSD has wrap problems:  the internal
    counter in the kernel is 32 bits, so once we receive 4G of
    traffic, we wrap, and it looks like we received a lot of
    negative traffic?  (I _think_ this is the cause).
