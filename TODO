* Do if(dolegends_) fix for loadmeter.cc for all ports.
* Add a version string, so that xosview -v prints out the version.

  Make xosview re-check resources when the resources are changed, 
    or when a signal is sent to it, or a key is pressed in it?

* Add command-line on/off switches for most, if not all, meters.
  Fix MeterMaker in the other (non-NetBSD) ports to check for all meters,
    not just load and serial.

* Add command-line arg for specifying an instance name, so that we can
    say "xosview -name xosview-stipple" and have the xosview-stipple*
    resources read in also.
  Redo the fieldmeter drawing code -- it (and the decayfieldmeter
    code) is very ugly.

* Add in stipple support for those stuck with 1-bit displays (black,
    or white) (just MacBSD people?).
  
* Make a better resource for turning meters off/on.  Currently, we
    overload other resources.

* If all meters are disabled, either via resources or command-line
    options, xosview dies from float-exception.  Probably, we're
    dividing by the number of meters somewhere.  Fix this.

  NetBSD:  Clean up symbol defs in netbsd.cc
  NetBSD:  Merge swapinternal.cc (or at least a lot of it) into kernel.cc
  NetBSD, Linux, hp:  Instead of allowing each meter to figure out the
    per-sec rate for a measurement (page, disk, net), add a fieldmeter
    function that does the calculation, using SAMPLE_MSECS and
    priority_.  See the netbsd/diskmeter.cc code for what I think is the
    correct formula (it took me a few attempts to get it right!)
  Fix depend stuff
* Get autolookup of X stuff -- perhaps use xmkmf/imake in configure?

  Change the CacheColor stuff from Tom Pavel's patches to be a
    new memWiredColor.

* Change the names on all NetBSD* functions to just be BSD*,
    since they are shared across multiple *BSD ports.

* Merge in NetBSD interrupt support.

* Add auto-detect for number of interrupts for NetBSD.

x Add in support and auto-detect for new NetBSD UVM stuff.
  (added, but no auto-detect).

  Merge in Tom's Xt stuff. -- deferred:  it appears to require
    Xt, Xaw, and ICE, IIRC, which bloats static executables too
    much for my taste.  bgrayson
