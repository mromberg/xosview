  To build xosview:

    Follow the instructions found in README.  In addition please consider
    the following:

      - xosview uses the C++ iostream library.  On linux this is usually
        distributed as part of libg++.  If you have an ELF system please
        check and make sure that you have a recent copy of libg++ from
        tsx-11.mit.edu:/pub/linux/packages/GCC as early ELF versions of
        libg++ were not compatable with code in the C library.  If you
        use one of these early ELF versions of libg++ xosview will probably
        crash due to a segmentation violation.

  To run xosview :

      - The network meter has been changed from the way it behaved in
        version 1.3.2.  It now displays the network usage in bytes / sec.
        This is done by using the IP accounting features of the kernel.
        In order for this new network meter to function you must do the
        following:

                  1 Make sure that IP accounting is enabled in your
                    kernel.  This means you may need to rebuild it.

                  2 Enable IP accounting for all IP packets into and out
                    of your machine.  This is done by using a program called
                    'ipfw'.  If you do not have this program on your system
                    it can be found as part of the net-tools package available
                    at your favorite Linux ftp site.  The example below is 
                    how I run ipfw to do this at boot time in my rc.local:

/sbin/ipfw add accounting all iface 192.168.0.3 from 192.168.0.3 to 0/0
/sbin/ipfw add accounting all iface 192.168.0.3 from 0/0 to 192.168.0.3

                    Just to make things interesting, it seems that kernels 
                    newer than 1.3.66 have made ipfw obsolete.  It has been
                    been replaced with ipfwadm.  Here is how to setup the
                    accounting using ipfwadm:

/sbin/ipfwadm -A -a -P all -S 192.168.0.3 -D 0/0
/sbin/ipfwadm -A -a -P all -S 0/0 -D 192.168.0.3

        If you do not do these steps, you will still be able to use xosview.
        You just will not be able to use the network meter.

      - The serial meter code in xosview-1.4 has been updated so that it
        displays more useful information.  To do this xosview now looks
        directly at a couple of the serial registers.  As a result of
        this, xosview now need to be suid root in order to use the serial
        meters.  If you try to use xosview with a serial meter enabled
        and it is not suid root it will display a message to this effect 
        and exit.  A non suid version of xosview will still function 
        normally.  It just will not be able to run with the serial meters
        toggled on.  I hope that at some point in the future the Linux
        /proc filesystem will provide some more useful serial stats and
        xosview will not have to be suid to get serial information.

To install xosview:
        
        If one installs xosview via the 'make install' target it will place
     things in the following locations.  The binary (xosview) will be copied
     to /usr/bin/X11/xosview and will be suid root.  If you do not want to
     run xosview suid root (this will just disable the serial meters) you
     can change the permissions to whatever you like.  The X defaults for
     xosview (Xdefaults) are copied to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XOsview.
