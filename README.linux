  To build xosview:

    Follow the instructions found in README.  In addition please consider
    the following:

      - xosview uses the C++ iostream library.  On linux this is usually
        distributed as part of libg++.  If you have an ELF system please
        check and make sure that you have a copy of libg++ which is 
        compatable with your C library.  This information can be gathered
        by reading the release notes for the libraries.  If you do not
        use compatable libraries xosview will probably crash due to a 
        segmentation violation.  In particular, recent redhat distributions 
        seem to have a libg++ which has bad strstream code in it.  Xosview
        is know to work with the following libc/libg++ combinations.  If you
        are having trouble with xosview dumping core in strstream code try
        one of these library combinations:

            libc.so.5.4.38, libstdc++.so.27.2.8

      - The memory meter can now display shared memory correctly.
        Unfortunatly, it needs more information than a "stock" linux
        kernel provides to do this.  It can get this information with
        the help of a kernel module (memstat.o) which is provided with
        this release.  If this module is not loaded, then xosview will
        not provide a "shared" memory field in the memory meter.

        The memstat module is now built by default thanks to Paal Beyer 
        <pbeyer@online.no> who provided code to make it work under linux
        2.1.  If you do not want to build the memstat modue you can run
        configure with a '--disable-linux-memstat' switch.

To install xosview:
        
        If one installs xosview via the 'make install' target it will place
     things in the following locations.  The binary (xosview) will be copied
     to /usr/bin/X11/xosview and will be suid root.  If you do not want to
     run xosview suid root (this will just disable the serial meters) you
     can change the permissions to whatever you like.  The X defaults for
     xosview (Xdefaults) are copied to /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XOsview.

  To run xosview :

      - The network meter has been changed from the way it behaved in
        version 1.3.2.  It now displays the network usage in bytes / sec.
        This is done by using the IP accounting features of the kernel.
        In order for this new network meter to function you must do the
        following:

                  1 Make sure that IP accounting is enabled in your
                    kernel.  This means you may need to rebuild it.

                  2 Enable IP accounting for all IP packets into and out
                    of your machine.  This is done by using a program called
                    'ipfwadm'.  The example below is how I run ipfwadm to do 
                    this at boot time in my rc.local:

/sbin/ipfwadm -A -a -P all -S 192.168.0.3 -D 0/0
/sbin/ipfwadm -A -a -P all -S 0/0 -D 192.168.0.3

        If you do not do these steps, you will still be able to use xosview.
        You just will not be able to use the network meter.

      - The serial meter code in has been updated so that it
        displays more useful information.  To do this xosview now looks
        directly at a couple of the serial registers.  As a result of
        this, xosview now need to be suid root in order to use the serial
        meters.  If you try to use xosview with a serial meter enabled
        and it is not suid root it will display a message to this effect 
        and exit.  A non suid version of xosview will still function 
        normally.  It just will not be able to run with the serial meters
        toggled on.  I hope that at some point in the future the Linux
        /proc filesystem will provide some more useful serial stats and
        xosview will not have to be suid to get serial information.

      - The memory meter no longer displays shared memory by default.  The
        information found in /proc/meminfo is not sufficient to figure out
        what percentage of real memory is being used for 'shared'.  There
        is a kernel module which comes with xosview that provides this 
        information.  It is found in the linux/memstat directory.  If this
        module is loaded into the kernel, a new entry will show up in /proc
        called /proc/memstat.  Xosview will display a shared memory field if
        it finds this file (ie the memstat module is loaded).

Other notes:
       
        Xosview should work for 2.0 and 2.1 kernels.  The memory meters have
        changed to use the new format of /proc/meminfo.  This means that
        xosview will probably no longer work for older kernels (somewhere
        in the 1.3 range).

        And finally, to all the folks who sent in linux related patches,
        I would like to give a big thanks.  Many of your patches made it
        into this release.  Many did not :(.  The good news is that I still
        have them, and if yours does not show up here, it should probably
        make it in shortly.  This release was delayed for some time due
        to an illness aquired by the maintainer.  I am feeling much better
        now and hope to be able to make much more frequent releases of
        xosview in the near future which will include your patches.
