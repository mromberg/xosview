  README for xosview-1.4.0:

  To build xosview:

    Version 1.4 requires gcc to compile.  Versions of gcc earlier than
    2.7.0 may fail to build xosview.  Please see the README file for
    your the platform you are building on for further details.

    edit Makefile.config for your setup.  Probably all you need to
    change here is the definition of your platform near the top.

    make


  To run xosview :

    Please see the README file for your platform for any special 
    instructions for running xosview on that platform.

    See the man page for information on what xosview displays and
    how you can customize it.

---- FAQ ----

1.  xosview seems to throw out any X-positional argument I give it.

Are you using fvwm/twm/tvtwm for a window manager?  If so, is the
NoPPosition (or UsePPosition) flag set in your .fvwmrc/.twmrc/.tvtwmrc
file?  Read the window-manager's man page to see how these variables
should be set.  Fvwm, and other window managers, use flags like this to
throw out the position part of the geometry string that an application
passes to it.
