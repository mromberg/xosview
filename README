  To build xosview:

    Xosview now uses gnu autoconfig.  There is hope that this will make
    building and installing it easier.  Still, this is the first attempt.
    So, if you find any trouble feel free to point it out.

    In general, you should be able to build xosview by following these
    steps:

    ./configure
    make
    make install    

    Versions 1.4 and later require gcc to compile.  Versions of gcc earlier 
    than 2.7.0 may fail to build xosview.  Please see the README file for
    your the platform you are building on for further details.

    edit Makefile.config for your setup, if you wish to change
    anything from the default settings, such as the optimization
    flags.  This of course, should be done before one runs make.

  To run xosview :

    Please see the README file for your platform for any special 
    instructions for running xosview on that platform.

    See the man page for information on the xosview display and
    how you can customize it.
