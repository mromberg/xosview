---- FAQ ----

1.  xosview seems to throw out any X-positional argument I give it.

Are you using fvwm/twm/tvtwm for a window manager?  If so, is the
NoPPosition (or UsePPosition) flag set in your .fvwmrc/.twmrc/.tvtwmrc
file?  Read the window-manager's man page to see how these variables
should be set.  Fvwm, and other window managers, use flags like this to
throw out the position part of the geometry string that an application
passes to it.
