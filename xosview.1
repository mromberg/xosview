.SH NAME
xosview \- X based system monitor
.SH SYNOPSIS
xosview [options]

.\"  First, let's define some handy roff macros.
.\"  A macro begins with .de <xx> where one will invoke this macro with .xx
.\"  The macro definition ends with the .. line.
.\"  I don't know what macro abbreviations are free, so I just chose a few,
.\"  and haven't noticed a problem so far!  bgrayson

.\"  There are several paragraphs that are repeated in the resource section.
.\"  Rather than typing the whole stuff out each time, we define a few macros.

.\"  The .pp macro takes a single argument (net, disk, etc), and
.\" prints a paragraph description of a Priority resource.  Only the
.\" header (xosview*diskPriority: \fIpriority\fP) needs to be specified in
.\" addition to the .pp macro.
.\"  Usage:   .pp load
.de pp
xosview*\\$1Priority: \fIpriority\fP
.RS
This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of
a second that the \\$1 meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview
update the meter 10 times per second (the fastest).  A value of 600 would
cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.
.RE
..

.\"  The .dc macro is similar to the .pp macro, except that it is for
.\" the decay resource paragraphs.
.\"  Usage:  .dc net
.de dc
xosview*\\$1Decay: (True or False)
.RS
If True then the \\$1 meter will be split vertically in two.  The top
half will show the instantaneous state, while the bottom half will
display a decaying average of the state.
.RE
..

.\"  The .pm macro is for ``plus/minus'' -- for the
.\"  enable/disable command-line options.
.de pm
-\\$1
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*\\$1 resource.  It is
equivalent to setting xosview*\\$1 to "False".
.RE

+\\$1
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*\\$1 resource.  It is
equivalent to setting xosview*\\$1 to "True".
.RE
..

.\"  The .xt macro is for ``Xresource true'' -- for enabling a
.\"  meter, like the .pm macro/-+foo.
.de xt
xosview*\\$1: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display a \\$1 meter.
.RE
..

.\"  The .uf macro is for the ``used format'' stuff.
.de uf
xosview*\\$1UsedFormat:	  (float, percent or autoscale)
.RS
This resource tells xosview how to display "used" labels.  The formats work
as follows:

\fBfloat\fP:
.RS
Display the value as a floating point number.
.RE
\fBpercent\fP:
.RS
Display the value as a percentage of the total.
.RE
\fBautoscale\fP:
.RS
Display the absolute value and automatically print the units (K, M, or G) as
appropriate.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIxosview\fP is a monitor which displays the status of several system based
parameters.  These include CPU usage, load average, memory usage, swap 
space usage, network usage, interrupts, and serial port status.  Each of 
these is displayed as a horizontal bar which is separated into color coded 
regions.  Each region represents a percentage of the resource which is being 
put to a particular use.  Typing a 'q' in the window will terminate xosview.

At the moment \fIxosview\fP runs on four platforms (Linux,
NetBSD, FreeBSD, and HPUX).
Not all of the meters described below are supported on all 
platforms.  Some of the meters may appear different depending upon the 
platform \fIxosview\fP is running on.

.SH OPTIONS

Most of these command line options are just a convenient way to set one or
more of xosview's resources.  Please see the \fBRESOURCES\fP section for
more details on what the resource is for.

-v
.RS
Displays the version number.
.RE

-name \fIname\fP
.RS
Sets the Resource name xosview will use (same as the -name option
for typical X applications like xterm).  When performing resource
lookups, xosview will look under \fIname\fP, and then under
``xosview''.  For an example, perform the following (as
documented in README.netbsd):
.RS
  xrdb -merge Xdefaults.stipple
  xosview -name xosvstipple &
  xosview -name xosvstipplebw &
.RE

.RE

-display \fIdisplay\fP
.RS
Sets the X display to \fIdisplay\fP.  This option overrides the 
xosview*display resource.
.RE

-font \fIfont\fP
.RS
Specifies the font xosview will use for labels.  This option overrides the
xosview*font resource.
.RE

-title \fItitle\fP
.RS
This option sets the name xosview will tell the window manager to use for
the X window and icon.  This option overrides the xosview*title resource.
.RE

-geometry \fIgeometry_string\fP
.RS
Sets the X geometry to \fIgeometry_string\fP.  This option overrides the
xosview*geometry resource.
.RE

.\"  Handle -/+labels
.pm labels

-usedlabels
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*usedlabels resource.  It is equivalent to
setting xosview*usedlabels to "False".
.RE

+usedlabels
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*usedlabels resource.  It is equivalent to
setting xosview*usedlabels to "True".
.RE

.\"  Handle -/+cpu
.pm cpu

.\"  Handle -/+load
.pm load

.\"  Handle -/+mem
.pm mem

.\"  Handle -/+swap
.pm swap

.\"  Handle -/+battery
.pm battery

.\"  Handle -/+net
.pm net

-network \fImaxbandwidth\fP 
.RE
-networkBW \fImaxbandwidth\fP 
.RE
-networkBandWidth \fImaxbandwidth\fP 
.RS
These options override the xosview*networkBandwidth resource.  They cause
xosview to display a meter that will shows network usage, with a maximum
bandwidth of \fBmaxbandwidth\fP.  Notice that setting the bandwidth to
0 no longer disables the meter -- use the ``-net'' option instead.
.RE

.\"  Handle -/+page
.pm page

-pagespeed \fIval\fP
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*pageBandWidth resource.  The resource
xosview*pageBandWidth will be set to \fIval\fP.
.RE

.\"  Handle -/+disk
.pm disk

-xrm \fIresource_string\fP
.RS
This switch allows any of xosview's resources to be set on the command line.
An example of how the xosview*memFreeColor could be set using this option is
shown below (Note the use of " to prevent the shell from expanding
\'*\' or from creating two separate arguments, \'xosview*memfreeColor:\'
and \'purple\'):
.RS
-xrm "xosview*memFreeColor: purple"
.RE
.RE

.SH X RESOURCES

The following is a list of X resources supported by \fIxosview\fP.  Each has
a default value assigned to it.  These values can be found in the file 
Xdefaults which can be obtained in the source distribution of xosview.
They can be overridden in the usual places (/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XOsview,
$HOME/.Xdefaults, etc.).

It should be noted that it is OK to have a resource defined for a port of 
xosview that does not support the feature the resource configures.  Xosview
will simply ignore the resources that are set for it but not supported on
a given platform.


\fBGeneral Resources\fP


xosview*title: \fIname\fP
.RS
The string that xosview will use for the X window title.  Normally xosview
will use 'xosview@machine_name' for a title.  This resource overrides the
default behavior.
.RE

xosview*geometry: \fIgeometry_string\fP
.RS
This is a standard X geometry string that defines the size and location of
the X window used by xosview.
.RE

xosview*display: \fIname\fP
.RS
The name of the display where xosview will contact the X server for drawing
its window.
.RE

xosview*labels: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display meter labels.
.RE

xosview*meterLabelColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
The color to use for the meter labels.
.RE

xosview*usedlabels: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display labels that show the percentage of the
resource (or absolute amount, depending on the meter) being used.  This
option requires that the labels option also be set to True.
.RE

xosview*usedLabelColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
The color to use for "used" labels.
.RE

xosview*borderwidth:  \fIwidth\fP
.RS
The width of the border for the xosview window.
.RE

xosview*font: \fIfont\fP
.RS
This is the font that xosview will use.
.RE

xosview*background: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used for the background.
.RE

xosview*foreground: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used for the foreground.
.RE

xosview*enableStipple:	(True or False)
.RS
Change to true to try beta stipple support.  This is primarily for users
stuck with 1-bit monitors/display cards.  Try setting enableStipple
true.  Please give us feedback on this, if you use it.  It needs
some more work.
.RE

xosview*net:	(True or False)
.RS
If True xosview will display the NetMeter.  Linux users will have to configure
their kernels and setup some ip accounting rules to make this work.  See the
file README.linux which comes with the xosview distribution for details.
.RE

xosview*netBandwidth: \fImaxBytes\fP
.RS
This number is used to specify the expected maximum bandwidth 
(in bytes / sec) for the meter.  When the expected maximum bandwidth 
(\fImaxBytes\fP) is exceeded then the network meter will display the 
relative percentage of network usage (25% incomming, 75% outgoing).
.RE

\fBSerial Meter Resources\fP


xosview*serial(0-9): (True, False, or portBase)
.RS
If True then xosview will display a serial meter for ttySx.  The
portbase will be autodetected.  Because autodetection can fail, (if
the port is locked by ppp/slip for example) you can specify the
portbase instead of "True".  If a portBase is used then xosview will use
it instead of trying to autodetect.

For this to work on Linux xosview needs to be suid root in order to have
access to the ports.  See the file README.linux which comes with the xosview
distribution for more details.
.RE

\fBInterrupt Meter Resources\fP


xosview*interrupts: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display an interrupt meter.
.RE

xosview*intOnColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used to show "active" interrupts.
.RE

xosview*intOffColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used to show "inactive" interrupts.
.RE


\fBBattery Meter Resources\fP


xosview*battery: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display a battery meter.  Linux users will need
to have APM support in their kernels for this to work.  See the file
README.linux which comes with the xosview distribution for more details.
.RE

xosview*batteryLeftColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used to show the amount of battery power left.

.RE

Occasionally (and unrepeatably), the NetBSD xosview will clobber the NET text
in the netmeter with horizontal black bars and the used-label numbers. 
I'm guessing this has something to do with the net numbers reaching some
unusual number (like 0 or maximum), but have not been able to pinpoint it
further.  BCG
