.SH NAME
xosview \- X based system monitor
.SH SYNOPSIS
xosview [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIxosview\fP is a monitor which displays the status of several system based
parameters.  These include CPU usage, load average, memory usage, swap 
space usage, network usage, interrupts, and serial port status.  Each of 
these is displayed as a horizontal bar which is separated into color coded 
regions.  Each region represents a percentage of the resource which is being 
put to a particular use.  Typing a 'q' in the window will terminate xosview.

At the moment \fIxosview\fP runs on three platforms (Linux, NetBSD, and HPUX).
Not all of the meters described below are supported on all 
platforms.  Some of the meters may appear different depending upon the 
platform \fIxosview\fP is running on.

.SH OPTIONS

Most of these command line options are just a convenient way to set one or
more of xosview's resources.  Please see the \fBRESOURCES\fP section for
more details on what the resource is for.

-display \fIdisplay\fP
.RS
Sets the X display to \fIdisplay\fP.  This option overrides the 
xosview*display resource.
.RE

-font \fIfont\fP
.RS
Specifies the font xosview will use for labels.  This option overrides the
xosview*font resource.
.RE

-title \fItitle\fP
.RS
This option sets the name xosview will tell the window manager to use for
the X window and icon.  This option overrides the xosview*title resource.
.RE

-geometry \fIgeometry_string\fP
.RS
Sets the X geometry to \fIgeometry_string\fP.  This option overrides the
xosview*geometry resource.
.RE

-labels
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*labels resource.  It is equivalent to setting
xosview*labels to "False".
.RE

+labels
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*labels resource.  It is equivalent to setting
xosview*labels to "True".
.RE

-load
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*load resource.  It is equivalent to setting
xosview*load to "False".
.RE

+load
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*load resource.  It is equivalent to setting
xosview*load to "True".
.RE

-disk
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*disk resource.  It is equivalent to setting
xosview*disk to "False".
.RE

+disk
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*disk resource.  It is equivalent to setting
xosview*disk to "True".
.RE

-page
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*page resource.  It is equivalent to setting
xosview*page to "False".
.RE

+page
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*page resource.  It is equivalent to setting
xosview*page to "True".
.RE

-pagespeed \fIval\fP
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*pageBandWidth resource.  The resource
xosview*pageBandWidth will be set to \fIval\fP.
.RE

+battery

.RE


-network \fImaxbandwidth\fP 
.RE
-networkBW \fImaxbandwidth\fP

-networkBandWidth \fImaxbandwidth\fP 
.RS
These options override the xosview*networkBandwidth resource.  They cause
xosview to display a meter that will shows network usage, with a maximum
bandwidth of \fBmaxbandwidth\fP.  Notice that setting the bandwidth to
0 no longer disables the meter -- use the ``-net'' option instead.

.RE

-xrm \fIresource_string\fP
.RS
This switch allows any of xosview's resources to be set on the command line.
An example of how the xosview*memFreeColor could be set using this option is
shown below (Note the use of " to prevent the shell from expanding
\'*\' or from creating two separate arguments, \'xosview*memfreeColor:\'
and \'purple\'):
.RS
-xrm "xosview*memFreeColor: purple"
.RE

.SH X RESOURCES

The following is a list of X resources supported by \fIxosview\fP.  Each has
a default value assigned to it.  These values can be found in the file 
defaultstring.h which can be obtained in the source distribution of xosview.
They can be overridden in the usual places (/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XOsview,
$HOME/.Xdefaults, etc.).

It should be noted that it is OK to have a resource defined for a port of 
xosview that does not support the feature the resource configures.  Xosview
will simply ignore the resources that are set for it but not supported on
a given platform.

\fBGeneral Resources\fP

its window.

will use 'xosview@machine_name' for a title.  This resource overrides the
default behavior.
.RE

.RS
If this number is 0, a netmeter will not be displayed.  Otherwise, this
number is used to specify the expected maximum bandwidth (in bytes / sec) for
the meter.  When the expected maximum bandwidth (\fImaxBytes\fP) is exceeded

\fIpriority\fP.  It can of couse be greater than 10.
.RE

xosview*netDecay: (True or False)
.RS
If True then the network meter will be split in two.  One half will show the
instantaneous state and the other will display a decaying average of the
state.
.RE

\fBSerial Meter Resources\fP

xosview*serial(0-9): (True, False, or portBase)
.RS
If True then xosview will display a serial meter for ttySx.  The
portbase will be autodetected.  Because autodetection can fail, (if
the port is locked by ppp/slip for example) you can specify the
portbase instead of "True".  If a portBase is used then xosview will use
it instead of trying to autodetect.
.RE

.RS
This is the color the serial meter will use for bits that are set.
.RE

xosview*serialOffColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS

This is the color that will be used to show the amount of battery power used.
.RE

xosview*batteryPriority: \fIpriority\fP
.RS
This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of times the 
battery meter will update per second.  The number of times this meter will

The memory meter does not make much sense at times under Linux.  This is due
to my ignorance as to what exactly the fields in /proc/meminfo mean.  Perhaps
someone who understands the entries in this file could enlighten me as to
their meaning and this bug could go away :).

Occasionally (and unrepeatably), the NetBSD xosview will clobber the NET text
in the netmeter with horizontal black bars and the used-label numbers. 
I'm guessing this has something to do with the net numbers reaching some
unusual number (like 0 or maximum), but have not been able to pinpoint it
further.  BCG
