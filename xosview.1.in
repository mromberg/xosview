xosview \- X based system monitor
.SH SYNOPSIS
xosview [options]
.\"  ================  Macros  =============================
.\"  First, let's define some handy roff macros.
.\"  A macro begins with .de <xx> where one will invoke this macro with .xx
.\"  The macro definition ends with the .. line.
.\"  I don't know what macro abbreviations are free, so I just chose a few,
.\"  and haven't noticed a problem so far!  bgrayson

.\"  There are several paragraphs that are repeated in the resource section.
.\"  Rather than typing the whole stuff out each time, we define a few macros.

.\"  The .pp macro takes a single argument (net, disk, etc), and
.\" prints a paragraph description of a Priority resource.  Only the
.\" header (xosview*diskPriority: \fIpriority\fP) needs to be specified in
.\" addition to the .pp macro.
.\"  Usage:   .pp load
.de pp
xosview*\\$1Priority: \fIpriority\fP
.RS
This number (which must be an integer >= 1) sets the number of tenths of
a second that the \\$1 meter waits between updates.  A value of 1 has xosview
update the meter 10 times per second (the fastest).  A value of 600 would
cause xosview to update the meter once a minute.
.RE
..
.\"  The .dc macro is similar to the .pp macro, except that it is for
.\" the decay resource paragraphs.
.\"  Usage:  .dc net
.de dc
xosview*\\$1Decay: (True or False)
.RS
If True then the \\$1 meter will be split vertically in two.  The top
half will show the instantaneous state, while the bottom half will
display a decaying average of the state.
.RE
..
.\" The .dg macro is similar to the .dc macro, except that it is for
.\" the scrolling graph resource paragraphs.
.\" Usage:  .dg net
.de dg
xosview*\\$1Graph: (True or False)
.RS
If this is set to True then the \\$1 meter will be drawn as a horizontally
scrolling bargraph showing the state value verses time.
.RE
..
.\"  The .pm macro is for ``plus/minus'' -- for the
.\"  enable/disable command-line options.
.de pm
-\\$1
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*\\$1 resource.  It is
equivalent to setting xosview*\\$1 to "False".
.RE
+\\$1
.RS
This option overrides the xosview*\\$1 resource.  It is
equivalent to setting xosview*\\$1 to "True".

.\"  The .ud macro is for the ``used decay'' option.
.de ud
xosview*\\$1UsedDecay:   (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display the used labels as an average
over the last N samples.  N is a vague number set at the
factory.  It reduces the text drawing load on the X server.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIxosview\fP is a program which displays the status of several system based
parameters.  These include CPU usage, load average, memory usage, swap
space usage, network usage, interrupts, and serial port status and more.
Each of these is displayed as a horizontal bar which is separated into color
coded regions.  Each region represents a percentage of the resource which is
being put to a particular use.  Typing a 'q' in the window will terminate
xosview.

At the moment \fIxosview\fP runs on eight platforms (Linux,
NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, some Solaris systems, IRIX 6.5, HPUX and GNU).
Not all of the meters described below are supported on all
platforms.  Some of the meters may appear different depending upon the
platform \fIxosview\fP is running on.  Note that *BSD is used as
an abbreviation for all three of the free BSD operating systems
(NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD).

.SH OPTIONS

Almost all of these command line options are just a convenient way to set one or
more of xosview's resources.  All resouces set on the command line will override
those specified anywhere else.  Please see the \fBRESOURCES\fP section for
more details on what the resource is for and for the overall scheme of how
resource values are found.

--help, -h
.RS
Displays usage information to stdout and exits.
.RE

--version, -v
.RS
Displays the version information and exits.
.RE

--display, -display \fIname\fP
.RS
Sets the X display to \fIname\fP.
.RE

--title, -title \fIname\fP
.RS
This option sets the name xosview will tell the window manager to use for
the X window and icon.  This option overrides the xosview*title resource.
.RE

-geometry, -g \fIgeometry\fP
.RS
Sets the X geometry to \fIgeometry_string\fP.  This option overrides the
xosview*geometry resource.
.RE

--foreground, -fg \fIcolor\fP
.RS
The \fIcolor\fP to use for the foreground.
.RE

--background, -bg \fIcolor\fP
.RS
The \fIcolor\fP to use for the background.
.RE

-font, -fn \fIfontName\fP
.RS
Specifies the \fIfontName\fP xosview will use for labels.  This option
overrides the xosview*font resource.  Not all fonts currently work well
with xosview.  For more details see the \fBRESOURCES\fP section.
.RE

--iconic, -iconic
.RS
Request to start in an iconic state.
.RE

--name, -name \fIname\fP
.RS
Sets the Resource name xosview will use (same as the -name option
for typical X applications like xterm).  When performing resource
lookups, xosview will look under \fIname\fP, and then under
``xosview''.
.RE

-xrm, -x \fIspec\fP
.RS
This switch allows any of xosview's resources to be set on the command line.
An example of how the xosview*memFreeColor could be set using this option is
shown below (Note the use of \(dq to prevent the shell from expanding
\'*\' or from creating two separate arguments, \'xosview*memfreeColor:\'
and \'purple\'):
.RS
-xrm "xosview*memFreeColor: purple"
.RE
.RE

--option, -o \fIspec\fP
.RS
This option is exactly the same as -xrm except that you do not need to
specify an instance name (such as xosview*).  It will be prepended for you.
So, this will also set the xosview*memFreeColor to purple:
.RS
-o "memFreeColor: purple"
.RE
.RE

--config, -c \fIfileName\fP
.RS
Load an XResource file.  This file will override (not replace) any previous
resources.  See the \fBRESOURCES\fP section for more details.
.RE

--xrm-dump, -xrmd
.RS
Dump the X resouces seen by xosview to stdout and exit.  This will show a
final list of all resources seen after loading and merging is finished.
.RE



.SH X RESOURCES

The following is a list of X resources supported by \fIxosview\fP.  Each has
a default value assigned to it.  These values can be found in the file
Xdefaults which can be obtained in the source distribution of xosview.
They can be overridden in the usual places (/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XOsview,
$HOME/.Xdefaults, etc.).

It should be noted that it is OK to have a resource defined for a port of
xosview that does not support the feature the resource configures.  Xosview
will simply ignore the resources that are set for it but not supported on
a given platform.

The resouces used by xosview are located and loaded in the following order.
Each layer overrides the previous.  And, of course, the best match is used.
For example ".xosview*font" overrides the more generic "*font".

.RS
.nr step 1 1
From first loaded/searched to last:
.IP \n[step] 3
An embeded copy of Xdefaults used to build xosview.  So, xosview always has
a default and complete set of resources even if all other options fail.
.IP \n+[step]
Standard X11 search paths and mechanics (XAPPLRESDIR, .Xdefault, xmodmap, etc).  For full details see the X documentation. The following is a short summary:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
From the class file (XOsview) found in the \fPapp-defaults\fI directory
configured into xosview at compile time.
.IP \[bu]
From the class file (XOsview) in the XAPPLRESDIR (environment variable).
.IP \[bu]
From resources loaded onto the Display of the X server (by xrdb for example).
.IP \[bu]
From resources loaded onto the Screen of the Display
(again by xrdb or the like).
.IP \[bu]
From the .Xdefaults file in the users HOME (environment variable) directory.  Xosview loads this file even if your X session did not.
.IP \[bu]
From resources found in the file specified by the XENVIRONMENT environment variable.
.RE
.IP \n+[step]
Resource files specified by the -c, --config command line arguments
.IP \n+[step]
Resources set by using the -xrm command line argument(s).
.IP \n+[step]
Command line options (such as -display) that set resources.
.RE

  Note that since xosview always starts off with a complete set of resources
it needs then you only need specify those options you would like to change from
their default values.  For example your .Xdefaults file could simply contain
the line "xosview*background: blue" if all you wish is an "stock" xosview
with a blue background.

\fBGeneral Resources\fP


xosview*title: \fIname\fP
.RS
The string that xosview will use for the X window title.  Normally xosview
will use 'xosview@machine_name' for a title.  This resource overrides the
default behavior.
.RE

xosview*geometry: \fIgeometry_string\fP
.RS
This is a standard X geometry string that defines the size and location of
the X window used by xosview.
.RE

xosview*display: \fIname\fP
.RS
The name of the display where xosview will contact the X server for drawing
its window.
.RE

xosview*pixmapName: \fIname\fP
.RS
The filename of an X pixmap (xpm) file for use as a background
image.
.RE

xosview*transparent: (True or False)
.RS
If True set the window background to transparent.  EXPERIMENTAL.
.RE

xosview*captions: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display meter captions.
.RE

xosview*labels: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display meter labels.
.RE

xosview*meterLabelColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
The color to use for the meter labels.
.RE

xosview*usedlabels: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display labels that show the percentage of the
resource (or absolute amount, depending on the meter) being used.  This
option requires that the labels option also be set to True.
.RE

xosview*usedLabelColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
The color to use for "used" labels.
.RE

xosview*font: \fIfont\fP
.RS
This is the font that xosview will use.  Currently the xosview text
rendering code assumes that a mono spaced (fixed width) font.  So,
things will most likely look poor with a non mono spaced font.  If the
build system supports Xft then xosview will switch to using freetype2 fonts.
Otherwise core X11 fonts are used.
.RE

xosview*background: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used for the background.
.RE

xosview*foreground: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used for the foreground.
.RE

xosview*enableStipple:	(True or False)
.RS
Change to true to try stipple support.  This is primarily for users
stuck with 1-bit monitors/display cards.  Try setting enableStipple
true.  Please give us feedback on this, if you use it.  It needs
some more work, but no one has given us any feedback so far.
.RE

xosview*graphNumCols: \fInumber\fP
.RS
This defines the number of sample bars drawn when a meter is in scrolling
graph mode. This also has the side-effect of defining the width of the
graph columns. This is only used by meters which have graph mode enabled.

If True then xosview will display a serial meter for ttySx.  The
portbase will be autodetected.  Because autodetection can fail, (if
the port is locked by ppp/slip for example) you can specify the
portbase instead of "True".  If a portBase is used then xosview will use
it instead of trying to autodetect.

xosview*interrupts: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display an interrupt meter.
.RE

xosview*intOnColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used to show "active" interrupts.
.RE

xosview*intOffColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used to show "inactive" interrupts.
.RE

xosview*intFormat: (single, all, both or auto)
.RS
Linux only.
.RE
.RS
If single, only a cumulative meter for all CPU is created. All creates a
meter for each CPU, but no cumulative meter. Both creates one cumulative
meter and one per cpu. auto behaves like single on uniprocessor system,
and like both on multiprocessor systems.

\fBLm Sensors Temperature Resources\fP

.xt lmstemp

xosview*lmstempHighest:	100
.RS
Highest temp value displayed, default 100.
.RE

xosview*lmstempActColor:  \fIcolor\fP
.RS
Color of actual temperature.
.RE

xosview*lmstempHighColor:  \fIcolor\fP
.RS
Color above alarm temperature, also used to indicate alarm.
.RE

xosview*lmstempIdleColor:   \fIcolor\fP
.RS
Color between actual and alarm temperatures.
.RE

xosview*lmstemp\fIN\fP:	\fIfilename\fP
.RS
Name of temperature file from /proc/sys/dev/sensors/*/*, N=1..
.br
Note if more files with same name exists, only the first is found. There is
currently no possiblity to configure equal named files on different busses
(which would be rarely necessary, I hope).

eg.
.br
xosview*lmstemp1:	temp
xosview*lmstemp2:	remote_temp
.RE

xosview*lmstempLabel\fIN\fP:	\fILabelstring\fP
.RS
N-th label for above temperatures, default is TMP.
.RE

\fBBattery Meter Resources\fP

xosview*battery: (True or False)
.RS
If True then xosview will display a battery meter.  Linux users will need
to have APM or ACPI support in their kernels for this to work.
For both, APM and ACPI xosview shows the status/sum of all batteries.
Additionally - the legend text gets changed/adjusted to reflect the
current state (charging/low/critical/etc.) of the battery/batteries.
.RE

xosview*batteryLeftColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used to show the amount of battery power left.
.RE

xosview*batteryUsedColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used to show the amount of battery power used.
.RE

xosview*batteryChargeColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used as 'left' - if the batteries get charged.
.RE

xosview*batteryFullColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
This is the color that will be used as 'left' - if the batteries are fully charged.
APM and ACPI does provide this info, but not all machines actually do so.
.RE

xosview*batteryLowColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
APM only - the 'left' color that will indicate a low battery.
Depends on the machine - e.g. below 25% remaining capacity.
.RE

xosview*batteryCritColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
APM case: the 'left' color if APM indicates 'critical' state. (less than 5%)

ACPI case: the 'left' color if the remaining capacity is below the alarm value.
(which can be set by the user in /proc/acpi/battery/BAT[01]/alarm )
.RE

xosview*batteryNoneColor: \fIcolor\fP
.RS
If no battery is present - or all batteries get removed (while on AC).
